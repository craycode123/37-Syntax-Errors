<div id="challenge-instructions"><h3>Syntax Errors</h3><div><p>When dealing with loops, it is common to encounter the following error message:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs ruby">syntax error, unexpected <span class="hljs-keyword">end</span>-of-input, expecting keyword_end</code></pre>
<p>The error type here is <code class="inline">SyntaxError</code>, which means that somewhere along in your code, you did not following a particular rule of the language you are coding in. For example, in Ruby, when you are defining a method, <code class="inline">def</code> must always follow by an <code class="inline">end</code>. Similarly, <code class="inline">if</code> must be followed by an <code class="inline">end</code>.</p>
<p>Thus, whenever you receive this error message, it is highly probable that you have forgotten to close a loop with an <code class="inline">end</code>, or did not end a method <code class="inline">def</code> with an <code class="inline">end</code>. </p>
<p>The code given in <code class="inline">syntax.rb</code> has several syntax errors. There are also errors in the algorithm. The output for 193 should be <strong>CXCIII</strong> instead of <strong>CLCIII</strong>. Not only that, It has also bad code style. Fix the given code so that it works! Improve the code style too while you are at it!</p>
